# Akusento 

Akusento is a chrome extension that colors or underlines japanese words according to their pitch accent. The different colors and styles can be tuned to preference.


# Pitch accent

The japanese language has 4 main pitch accent patterns; heiban(平板), atamadaka(頭高), nakadaka(中高) and odaka(尾高); a 5th one sometimes combined with nakadaka(中高) is called kifuku(起伏). Correct pitch accent usage is not mandatory for comprehension of the language but is an essential part of sounding native.
